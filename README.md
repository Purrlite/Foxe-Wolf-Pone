Foxe Wolf Pone [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Purrlite/Foxe-Wolf-Pone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Purrlite/Foxe-Wolf-Pone)
==============

It's basically Tic Tac Toe made in Haskell, with the option to render it using animal characters from Unicode.

---

Use command arguments to tell the executable if to use animal or standard (Tic Tac Toe) rendering. You can also use "help" as a command argument in case you aren't sure what the arguments are exactly.

_Note that as of writing this README I don't know of any font that can render the animal characters from Unicode, so it likely won't work with them yet._
